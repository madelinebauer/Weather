# Weather App 
Python project to look up current weather conditions

The user is prompted to enter a city name and state name. The Python file returns the current temperature, feels like temperature, high temperature, low temperature, humidity and windspeed. The app uses a loop so that the user can continue looking up weather for any city/state combination and is prompted to enter 'q' when wanting to leave the app.
