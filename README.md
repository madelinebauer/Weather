# Weather App 
Python project to look up current weather conditions in any U.S. city.

The user is prompted to enter a city name and state name. The Python file returns the following:
  1. Current temperature
  2. Feels like temperature
  3. High temperature
  4. Low temperature
  5. Humidity  
  6. Windspeed 
 
The app uses a loop so that the user can continue looking up weather for any city/state combination and is prompted to enter 'q' when wanting to leave the app. 

This project was created to learn the fundamentals of connecting to an API, using JSON, and Python skills (for loops, try/except, etc.).
